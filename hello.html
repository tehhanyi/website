<h1> A message before I passed on </h1>
<p> I find no meaning in life</p>
	<div> we live in a world where our hearts are found in earthy materials and status <br> do we actually care for the people around us? <br> will we die for them?<div>
<h2> it's like our lives don't make us matter at all </h2>
<p> we spend majority of our time and efforts chasing after things that we can't bring to our graves and earning after short-term rewards <br> do it matter? will all of these matter in the end? <br> happiness and memories will cease to exist after our lifetime as if it never happened </p>
<h1> Are we living right? </h1>
	<div> I really do fucking hope there's more to life
	</div>
